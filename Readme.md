# Expected depth per gene for a run (DNAnexus Platform App)

Calculates the expected depth per gene for a whole run.

This app requires all the region coverage files with their indexes and all the flagstat files for the whole run.
It outputs one file with the expected depth for each genomic region covered by the capture. The header contains the script name and all the samples used to calculate this. The rest of the file includes the genomic region (chrom, start, end), expected depth for that region and standard deviation.
